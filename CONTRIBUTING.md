# How to Contribute


Step 1: Feature Request
======================================
Start putting a [feature request](https://github.com/bhagvank/Montecarlo_Quant/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) for your idea...



Step 2: Fork, Commit, and Pull Request
======================================
GitHub has some great documentation on [how to fork a git repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo). Once
you've done that, make your changes and [send us a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)! Be sure to
include a detailed description for your pull request, so that a community
manager can understand *what* change you're making, *why* you're making it, *how*
it should work now, and how you can *test* that it's working correctly.



Step 3: Code Review by Core Committer(s)
========================================

If your pull request meets the requirements and it hasn't been rejected by a product owner,
then it will be scheduled for code review by one or more core committers. This
process sometimes takes awhile: most of the core committers on the project
are members of the project, and they have to balance their time between code review
and new development.

Step 4: Merge!
==============

Once the core committers are satisfied that your pull request is ready to go,
one of them will merge it for you. Your code will end up in the next release, which usually which happens every week. Congrats!
